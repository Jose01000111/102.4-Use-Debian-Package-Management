# 🖥️ 102.4-Use-Debian-Package-Management

## 🖧  Introduction
I explored core package management tools in Debian 🐧. These tools are essential for Linux administrators and are heavily tested in the LPIC-1 exam. I focused on both manual .deb installs and working with APT repositories. 💻

I’ve included some helpful links to guide you through the lab and for studying afterward:
